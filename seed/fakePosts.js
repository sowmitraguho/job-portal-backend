    postTitle: "The Myth of ‘Perfect Job’ — What I Learned After Switching Twice",
    postImage: "https://i.ibb.co/6wDFf9h/perfect-job.jpg",
    post: "When I started my career, I was obsessed with finding the 'perfect job' — high pay, great culture, remote flexibility, and meaningful work. But after switching two companies in less than two years, I realized something uncomfortable: perfection doesn’t exist. Every role has trade-offs. One had great pay but no work-life balance, the other offered flexibility but little career growth. What matters most is knowing your priorities — what you value today might not be the same a year later. I’ve learned to focus on growth, not perfection. The more I stopped chasing an ideal, the happier I became in my current role. 🌻",

    postTitle: "Remote Work Burnout is Real — Here’s How I Recovered",
    postImage: "https://i.ibb.co/SRhCQsm/remote-burnout.jpg",
    post: "Working remotely was my dream come true — until I found myself working from sunrise to midnight. There was no ‘office time,’ no commute, and apparently… no boundaries. It started to affect my sleep, health, and creativity. One day, I decided to ‘log off’ for real — I took a weekend trip without my laptop and came back with a plan: fixed hours, no notifications after 8 PM, and morning walks before checking emails. It changed everything. Remote work can be freeing, but only if you set boundaries. Don’t let your home turn into a 24/7 office. Your mental health matters more than deadlines. 🌿",

  postTitle: "Office Politics — What I Learned by Staying Neutral",
  postImage: "https://i.ibb.co/BqCBPwP/office-politics.jpg",
  post: "In my first corporate job, I was shocked by how subtle office politics can be. People forming cliques, gossiping about promotions, or taking credit for others’ work — it was exhausting. At first, I tried to fit in, but that only drained my energy. Eventually, I realized that the best strategy is neutrality. I focused on my tasks, kept communication transparent, and avoided gossip. Over time, even the so-called ‘difficult’ colleagues started respecting me for my professionalism. Office politics will always exist, but your integrity is your shield. Be kind, but stay grounded — that’s the real power move. 💼",
